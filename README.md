# Troner
Multiplayer Tron Game

##Warning
For now game is a little bugy. We are going through a process of software optimitzation.

##Run the game
You'll need mysql database, two computers connected to the same LAN and the Java Virtual Machine.

Run the script serverDatabase.sql in your mysql database.
Run the server program.
Then run the client program.
On the client program you'll see that you need to enter the IP and the Port where the server is offering the Game.
For now you'll just have to look through the code wich port is it. Thank you for your comprehension.
